          I conducted extensive user research to gain a deep understanding of
          the needs, preferences, and pain points of both customers and staff
          who will interact with the POS system. The research serves as a guide
          throughout the design process, ensuring that the system is tailored to
          meet the specific requirements and expectations of the users. By
          incorporating user insights, I designed a POS system that delivers a
          seamless and user-friendly experience for all stakeholders involved.
